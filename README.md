# Coursera_Getting_Cleaning_Data

README

The AvgReadings_by_Subj_Activity.txt file generated by my R code (run_analysis.R)
is a 180 x 68 file that contains the data from 30 subjects (humans wearing some devices)
engaged in 6 different activities (walking, sitting, laying, standing, walking up or down).

The specific figures in each column represent an average of the multiple readings of mean 
and standard deviations in a variety of motions in the X-, Y-, and Z- directions, 
magnitudes etc. that were captured as the subjects engaged in the various activities.
There were a total of 66 different measurement types (columns) pretaining to mean and 
standard deviations of readings, out of an original assortment of 561 columns. 

The data are from the UCI data repository and provided by Professor Leek on the Coursera
website. 

In my repository is the original UCI_README.txt file from the UCI folks, which explains the 
actual science (or math?) behind the data. I do not understand any of it and will take my 
demerits in terms of this assignment, as I am unable to explain in any intelligible way.

More specific information regarding abbreviations and conventions I used to name the
columns are explained in the CodeBook.md file, also provided in this repository.

Thank you and all my best to my classmates.
